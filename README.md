# Description
A library for my future mods to depend on.
Provides solutions for some of the annoying parts of mod development.
Currently the library provides some helpers for client configuration and configuration screens

I wouldnt suggest using this mod for your projects, there are obviusly better libraries for this purpose such as cloth-config and owo-lib.
I am just making this for fun

# Usage
